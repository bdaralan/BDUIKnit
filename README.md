### Quick Introduction

Most of the UI components are following **MVVM** design pattern; so, there will always be **Views** and their corresponding **View Models**. Some view model has UI customization properties. Others are extracted out to a configuration object. Not all view models are `class`, some of them are `struct`. So, use `@ObservedObject`, `@State`, or `@Binding` as needed.
