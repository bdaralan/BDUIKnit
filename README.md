## UI Preview

### Quick Introduction

Most of the UI components are following **MVVM** design pattern; so, there will always be **Views** and their corresponding **View Models**. Some view model has UI customization properties. Others are extracted out to a configuration object. Not all view models are `class`, some of them are `struct`.

### `BDButtonTrayView`

A tray-like view that is normally pinned to the bottom-trailing of a scene.
